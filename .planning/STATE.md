## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8 phases derived from 53 requirements; consulting funnel (Phase 8) is independent and can parallelize with newsletter phases
- [Roadmap]: Domain warm-up and A2P 10DLC registration must start in Phase 1 due to 4-6 week and 10-15 day lead times respectively
- [Roadmap]: AI Research Engine (Phase 3) is the highest-risk, highest-value component with 11 requirements and 6 plans

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: API cost at scale -- per-subscriber costs could reach $1,200-1,500/month at 1,000 subscribers without topic clustering and model optimization
- [Research]: Domain warm-up takes 4-6 weeks -- email deliverability depends on starting this process early
- [Research]: A2P 10DLC registration takes 10-15 business days -- must initiate before Phase 7 (SMS) can ship
