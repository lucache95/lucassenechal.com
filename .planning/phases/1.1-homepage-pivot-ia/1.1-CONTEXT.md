# Phase 1.1: Homepage Pivot & Information Architecture - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Note:** User delegated all decisions ("run autonomously, I trust your defaults"). Decisions below are Claude's best judgment based on project context, ChatGPT strategy session notes, and Phase 1 aesthetic.

## Phase Boundary

Transform the homepage from newsletter-first to consulting-first. Relocate existing newsletter landing page content to /newsletter as a dedicated route. Establish the information architecture with three front doors: / (consulting homepage), /newsletter (newsletter signup), /work-with-me (placeholder or link until Phase 3). Navigation ties all three together.

## Implementation Decisions

### Homepage Hero & Value Prop
- Hero headline communicates the core wedge: AI systems that eliminate repetitive admin and follow-ups so teams scale revenue without scaling headcount
- Do NOT use "30/60 days" or specific timeframe promises in positioning. Timeframes only in productized deliverables.
- Primary CTA: "Work With Me" button — prominent, high-contrast, links to /work-with-me
- Secondary CTA: "Get the Daily Briefing" — smaller, below primary, links to /newsletter. Framed as proof-of-work ("See what my AI builds every day")
- Hero should feel like a confident consultant's page, not a SaaS landing page. Think: personal brand + capability demonstration
- F/G/E copy framework applies: Fear (competitors using AI while you're not), Greed (operational leverage, scale without headcount), Ego (be the leader who modernized)
- Include a brief "what I do" blurb under the headline — 1-2 sentences max, plain language

### Homepage Page Structure (top to bottom)
1. **Hero section**: Value prop headline + dual CTAs + brief blurb
2. **What I Build section**: 3-4 cards showing service categories (AI automation, process consulting, ongoing management, training) — each with a one-liner and icon. Not full descriptions (that's /work-with-me), just enough to show breadth
3. **Proof section**: Social proof / capability demonstration. Could include: the trust strip (reused from Phase 1, "Built with the best in the game"), a brief "About" block (reuse Phase 1 about section — photo, stats, short bio), and/or a "The newsletter is my proof of work" teaser linking to /newsletter
4. **Footer**: Same as Phase 1 (privacy, terms links)
- No sticky CTA on homepage (that belongs on /newsletter)
- Keep it tight — homepage should be scannable in 10 seconds. The goal is routing, not convincing on this page.

### Newsletter Page (/newsletter)
- Move ALL existing landing page content here: hero (with newsletter-specific headline), trust strip, example cards, how-it-works, about section, footer, sticky CTA
- The hero headline stays newsletter-focused: "Your daily edge, researched by AI"
- Email capture stays as the primary CTA on this page
- Add a subtle "Hired by" / "Work With Me" link in the newsletter page header or near the about section — cross-pollination without being pushy
- Route: `app/(marketing)/newsletter/page.tsx` or restructure route groups as needed
- The existing `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` becomes the new consulting homepage

### Navigation & Routing
- Simple top nav bar on all pages: Logo (links to /) + "Newsletter" link + "Work With Me" link
- Nav should be minimal — no mega-menus, no dropdowns. Just the three core routes.
- /work-with-me can be a placeholder page for now ("Coming soon — in the meantime, email me at lucas@lucassenechal.com") since the full intake is Phase 3
- Mobile: hamburger menu or just show both links inline (they're only 2 items)
- Logo: "Lucas Senechal" text mark or initials "LS" — no image logo needed for v1

### Tone & Credibility
- Humble but confident: "I build AI systems that..." not "I'm the best at..."
- Use "always learning" energy without sounding junior — show capability through what you've built, not claims
- The about section (reused on both homepage and /newsletter) establishes credibility through stats (100k+ followers, 16h/day with AI) and personal photo
- No testimonials needed for v1 — the newsletter IS the testimonial (proof of work)
- Avoid corporate speak: no "solutions", "leverage synergies", "digital transformation". Keep it human.

### Design Continuity
- Same Tailwind v4 theme, slate/blue palette, Framer Motion animations from Phase 1
- Consistent component library — reuse existing components where possible (trust strip, about section, footer)
- New components needed: homepage hero (different from newsletter hero), services/what-I-build cards, top nav bar
- Keep the same light-only theme, same typography (Geist font)

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact homepage layout proportions and spacing
- Whether to use a full "About" section on homepage or a condensed version
- How to visually differentiate the homepage hero from the newsletter hero
- Animation choices for new sections
- Whether /work-with-me placeholder is a simple page or a styled "coming soon" card
- Mobile nav implementation (hamburger vs inline links)

## Specific Ideas

- Homepage should feel like visiting a confident freelancer/consultant's site — someone who clearly knows what they're doing. References: Cal.com's clean authority, Vercel's "show don't tell" approach
- The "What I Build" cards should NOT be full service descriptions — just enough to signal breadth. Think: icon + title + one sentence. Full details live on /work-with-me.
- Cross-pollination between pages: homepage mentions newsletter as proof, newsletter page mentions consulting as next step. Neither is pushy — just available.
- The existing Phase 1 landing page components are well-built and should be reused, not rewritten. The migration is mostly about routing, not redesign.

## Deferred Ideas

- Full /work-with-me consulting page with service descriptions and intake form — Phase 3
- Tech stack pages (each logo links to a page explaining the technology) — v2 backlog (SEO-02)
- Public blog posts from newsletter reports for SEO — v2 backlog (SEO-01)
- Clickable trust strip logos linking to tech explanation pages — v2 backlog
