# Phase 1.1: Homepage Pivot & Information Architecture - Research

**Researched:** 2026-02-21
**Domain:** Next.js App Router routing restructure, component migration, consulting-first landing page design
**Confidence:** HIGH

## Summary

Phase 1.1 is primarily a routing restructure and new page creation task, not a rebuild. The existing codebase at `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` currently renders a newsletter-first landing page composed of 7 well-built components (HeroSection, TrustStrip, ExampleCards, HowItWorks, About, Footer, StickyCTA). The task is to:

1. Transform `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` into a consulting-first homepage with new hero, "What I Build" service cards, proof section (reusing About + TrustStrip), and footer.
2. Move the existing newsletter landing page content to `app/(marketing)/newsletter/page.tsx` with all its current components intact.
3. Create a `/work-with-me` placeholder page.
4. Add a shared navigation bar across all marketing pages via the `app/(marketing)/layout.tsx` file.
5. Update root metadata to reflect the consulting-first positioning.

No new dependencies are required. The existing stack (Next.js 16.1.6, React 19.2.3, Tailwind v4, Framer Motion 12.34.3) fully supports everything needed. The work is routing, component composition, and new UI creation using established patterns.

**Primary recommendation:** Leverage the existing `(marketing)` route group layout for the shared nav bar, create the newsletter page as a nested route within the same group, and build new homepage components following the exact same patterns (Framer Motion variants, Tailwind theme tokens, component structure) already established in Phase 1.

## User Constraints (from CONTEXT.md)

### Locked Decisions
- Hero headline communicates the core wedge: AI systems that eliminate repetitive admin and follow-ups so teams scale revenue without scaling headcount
- Do NOT use "30/60 days" or specific timeframe promises in positioning. Timeframes only in productized deliverables.
- Primary CTA: "Work With Me" button -- prominent, high-contrast, links to /work-with-me
- Secondary CTA: "Get the Daily Briefing" -- smaller, below primary, links to /newsletter. Framed as proof-of-work ("See what my AI builds every day")
- Hero should feel like a confident consultant's page, not a SaaS landing page. Think: personal brand + capability demonstration
- F/G/E copy framework applies: Fear (competitors using AI while you're not), Greed (operational leverage, scale without headcount), Ego (be the leader who modernized)
- Include a brief "what I do" blurb under the headline -- 1-2 sentences max, plain language
- Homepage page structure (top to bottom): Hero section, What I Build section (3-4 cards), Proof section (trust strip + about + newsletter teaser), Footer
- No sticky CTA on homepage (that belongs on /newsletter)
- Keep it tight -- homepage should be scannable in 10 seconds. The goal is routing, not convincing on this page.
- Move ALL existing landing page content to /newsletter: hero (with newsletter-specific headline), trust strip, example cards, how-it-works, about section, footer, sticky CTA
- The hero headline stays newsletter-focused: "Your daily edge, researched by AI"
- Email capture stays as the primary CTA on /newsletter
- Add a subtle "Work With Me" link in the newsletter page header or near the about section -- cross-pollination without being pushy
- Simple top nav bar on all pages: Logo (links to /) + "Newsletter" link + "Work With Me" link
- Nav should be minimal -- no mega-menus, no dropdowns. Just the three core routes.
- /work-with-me can be a placeholder page for now ("Coming soon -- in the meantime, email me at lucas@lucassenechal.com") since the full intake is Phase 3
- Mobile: hamburger menu or just show both links inline (they're only 2 items)
- Logo: "Lucas Senechal" text mark or initials "LS" -- no image logo needed for v1
- Humble but confident tone: "I build AI systems that..." not "I'm the best at..."
- Same Tailwind v4 theme, slate/blue palette, Framer Motion animations from Phase 1
- Consistent component library -- reuse existing components where possible (trust strip, about section, footer)
- New components needed: homepage hero (different from newsletter hero), services/what-I-build cards, top nav bar
- Keep the same light-only theme, same typography (Geist font)

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact homepage layout proportions and spacing
- Whether to use a full "About" section on homepage or a condensed version
- How to visually differentiate the homepage hero from the newsletter hero
- Animation choices for new sections
- Whether /work-with-me placeholder is a simple page or a styled "coming soon" card
- Mobile nav implementation (hamburger vs inline links)

### Deferred Ideas (OUT OF SCOPE)
- Full /work-with-me consulting page with service descriptions and intake form -- Phase 3
- Tech stack pages (each logo links to a page explaining the technology) -- v2 backlog (SEO-02)
- Public blog posts from newsletter reports for SEO -- v2 backlog (SEO-01)
- Clickable trust strip logos linking to tech explanation pages -- v2 backlog

<phase_requirements>
## Phase Requirements

| ID | Description | Research Support |
|----|-------------|-----------------|
| HOME-01 | Consulting-first homepage at / that clearly communicates the value prop: AI systems that eliminate admin/follow-ups for revenue scaling | New homepage hero component with consulting-focused headline, blurb, and dual CTAs. Replaces current newsletter hero in `app/(marketing)/page.tsx`. Architecture pattern: same Framer Motion stagger animation as existing hero, new copy per CONTEXT.md decisions. |
| HOME-02 | Primary CTA "Work With Me" -- direct path for high-intent buyers | Button component (existing `Button` with `variant="primary"`, `size="lg"`) linking to `/work-with-me` via Next.js `Link`. High-contrast blue accent per theme tokens. |
| HOME-03 | Secondary CTA "Get the Daily Briefing" -- newsletter framed as proof-of-work and lead magnet | Smaller button or text link below primary CTA. Use existing `Button` with `variant="secondary"` or `variant="ghost"` linking to `/newsletter`. |
| HOME-04 | Dedicated newsletter landing page at /newsletter with existing landing page content (hero, example cards, how-it-works, trust strip, about, footer) | Create `app/(marketing)/newsletter/page.tsx` composing all existing `components/landing/*` components. No component changes needed -- just re-composition at a new route. StickyCTA included on this page only. |
| HOME-05 | Humble but confident tone throughout -- "always learning" without sounding junior. Niche by pain, not industry. | Copy guidance from CONTEXT.md. F/G/E framework. Avoid corporate speak, avoid SaaS patterns. Research confirms this is a copy/content concern, not a technical one. |
| HOME-06 | Fully responsive with premium animations (Framer Motion), consistent with existing site quality | Existing Framer Motion patterns (containerVariants/childVariants stagger, whileInView viewport triggers, spring animations) provide the template. New components follow identical patterns. Tailwind responsive breakpoints (sm/md/lg/xl) already established. |
| COPY-03 | Homepage and consulting page use F/G/E with consulting-specific framing | Copy direction locked in CONTEXT.md. Implementation is in hero headline, blurb, and "What I Build" card descriptions. |

### Pattern 1: Route Group Shared Layout for Navigation
**What:** Use the existing `(marketing)` route group layout to add a shared navigation bar across all marketing pages (/, /newsletter, /work-with-me, /legal/*).
**When to use:** When multiple pages need the same persistent UI (navigation) without affecting URL paths.
**Why this works:** The `(marketing)/layout.tsx` is currently an empty passthrough (`<>{children}</>`). Adding the nav bar here means every page under `(marketing)` gets it automatically -- homepage, newsletter, work-with-me, and legal pages.
**Example:**
```typescript
// app/(marketing)/layout.tsx
import { NavBar } from "@/components/navigation/nav-bar";

export default function MarketingLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <>
      <NavBar />
      {children}
    </>
  );
}
```

### Pattern 2: Component Composition for Page Variants
**What:** Each page.tsx is a thin composition layer that imports and arranges shared components.
**When to use:** When multiple pages share some but not all components.
**Why this works:** The newsletter page reuses ALL existing components with zero modifications. The homepage reuses About, TrustStrip, and Footer while adding new consulting-specific components. No component needs to change -- only the composition changes.
**Example:**
```typescript
// app/(marketing)/newsletter/page.tsx
import { HeroSection } from "@/components/landing/hero";
import { ExampleCards } from "@/components/landing/example-cards";
import { HowItWorks } from "@/components/landing/how-it-works";
import { TrustStrip } from "@/components/landing/trust-strip";
import { About } from "@/components/landing/about";
import { Footer } from "@/components/landing/footer";
import { StickyCTA } from "@/components/landing/sticky-cta";

export default function NewsletterPage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <HeroSection />
      <TrustStrip />
      <ExampleCards />
      <HowItWorks />
      <About />
      <Footer />
      <StickyCTA />
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Pattern 3: Per-Page Metadata via Export
**What:** Each page.tsx exports its own `metadata` object for SEO/OG tags, overriding the root layout defaults.
**When to use:** Every page in Phase 1.1 needs distinct metadata (title, description, OG tags).
**Why this works:** Next.js App Router merges metadata from parent layouts with page-level metadata. Pages can override any field. The root `layout.tsx` currently has newsletter-focused metadata that needs updating.
**Example:**
```typescript
// app/(marketing)/newsletter/page.tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "The Daily Briefing | Lucas Senechal",
  description: "Your daily edge, researched by AI. A personalized newsletter tailored to exactly what you care about.",
  openGraph: {
    title: "The Daily Briefing | Lucas Senechal",
    description: "Every morning, get a briefing researched and written just for you.",
    url: "https://lucassenechal.com/newsletter",
  },
};
```

### Pattern 4: Framer Motion Stagger Animation (Established Pattern)
**What:** Container with staggerChildren + child variants for entrance animations.
**When to use:** Every new section that needs progressive reveal on load/scroll.
**Why this works:** Already used in HeroSection, ExampleCards, HowItWorks, About. New components must follow the same pattern for visual consistency.
**Example:**
```typescript
// Reuse this exact pattern from existing hero.tsx
const containerVariants = {
  hidden: {},
  visible: {
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.15,
    },
  },
};

const childVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      duration: 0.6,
      ease: [0.25, 0.4, 0.25, 1],
    },
  },
};
```

### Pattern 5: Viewport-Triggered Animations (Established Pattern)
**What:** Components animate when they enter the viewport using `whileInView`.
**When to use:** For below-the-fold sections like "What I Build" cards, proof section.
**Why this works:** Used in ExampleCards, HowItWorks, About. Prevents animations from firing before user scrolls to them.
**Example:**
```typescript
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 30 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true, margin: "-50px" }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay: index * 0.08, ease: [0.25, 0.4, 0.25, 1] }}
>
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Duplicating components instead of reusing:** Do NOT copy hero.tsx to make a consulting hero. Create a new `consulting-hero.tsx` component. The existing hero.tsx must remain untouched for the newsletter page.
- **Modifying existing components to add conditionals:** Do NOT add "isHomepage" props to existing components. If the homepage needs a different version, create a new component. Shared components (TrustStrip, About, Footer) should work on both pages without any changes.
- **Creating a separate root layout:** Do NOT create a second route group with its own root layout. All marketing pages should share the same `(marketing)/layout.tsx` to enable client-side navigation without full page reloads.
- **Page transitions between routes:** Do NOT attempt to add animated page transitions between / and /newsletter. This is complex with the App Router, requires FrozenRouter hacks, and is out of scope. Each page has its own entrance animations -- that is sufficient.

## Don't Hand-Roll

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Navigation highlighting (active link) | Custom state tracking for current route | `usePathname()` from `next/navigation` | Built-in hook, SSR-compatible, updates on client-side navigation |
| Responsive mobile menu | Custom CSS media queries + JS state | Tailwind responsive classes (`hidden md:flex` / `flex md:hidden`) + simple useState toggle | Tailwind breakpoints already established in project; consistent with existing responsive patterns |
| Link prefetching | Manual route preloading | Next.js `<Link>` component | Automatic prefetching on viewport entry built into Next.js Link |
| Smooth scroll to sections | Custom scroll behavior JS | CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth` (already in globals.css) + anchor `href="#section-id"` | Already configured in globals.css |
| Animation variants | Different animation timings per component | Reuse existing `containerVariants`/`childVariants` pattern | Visual consistency; DRY; proven timing values |

**Key insight:** Phase 1.1 has zero cases where a new library or hand-rolled solution is needed. Every pattern already exists in the codebase -- the task is composition and routing, not invention.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Breaking the Newsletter Page During Homepage Refactor
**What goes wrong:** Developer modifies `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` for the new homepage but forgets to create `app/(marketing)/newsletter/page.tsx` first, leaving newsletter content unreachable.
**Why it happens:** It is natural to start with the exciting new homepage and defer the "boring" content migration.
**How to avoid:** Create the newsletter page FIRST by moving the current page.tsx content to newsletter/page.tsx. Verify it renders at /newsletter. THEN replace page.tsx with the new homepage. This ensures zero content loss at any point.
**Warning signs:** Visiting /newsletter returns 404 during development.

### Pitfall 2: Client Component Boundary in Layout
**What goes wrong:** Adding `"use client"` to the marketing layout because the nav bar needs `usePathname()`, which then prevents Server Components in child pages.
**Why it happens:** `usePathname()` is a client hook, and developers put it directly in the layout.
**How to avoid:** Keep the marketing layout as a Server Component. The nav bar component itself should be `"use client"`, imported into the layout. Child pages remain Server Components (which is important for metadata exports).
**Warning signs:** Metadata exports stop working, or unnecessary JS gets shipped to the client.

### Pitfall 3: Root Metadata Not Updated
**What goes wrong:** The root `layout.tsx` still has newsletter-focused metadata ("Your Daily Edge"), so the homepage inherits stale OG tags.
**Why it happens:** Developer focuses on page-level metadata and forgets the root.
**How to avoid:** Update root `layout.tsx` metadata to consulting-first messaging. Each page.tsx then overrides with page-specific metadata. Check with OG debugger.
**Warning signs:** Social media previews show newsletter copy when sharing the homepage URL.

### Pitfall 4: Inconsistent Theme Tokens in New Components
**What goes wrong:** New homepage components use raw color values (`#2563eb`, `text-blue-600`) instead of theme tokens (`text-accent`, `bg-surface`).
**Why it happens:** Developer copies from external examples or writes CSS from memory instead of referencing existing components.
**How to avoid:** ONLY use theme token classes defined in globals.css: `foreground`, `muted`, `muted-foreground`, `border`, `accent`, `accent-foreground`, `accent-hover`, `surface`, `surface-hover`, `surface-active`, `background`. Never use raw Tailwind colors.
**Warning signs:** Colors don't match across pages, or slight color mismatches appear.

### Pitfall 5: StickyCTA Appearing on Homepage
**What goes wrong:** The sticky email capture bar shows up on the homepage because it was included in the layout rather than just the newsletter page.
**Why it happens:** Developer puts StickyCTA in the marketing layout for convenience.
**How to avoid:** StickyCTA must only be imported in `app/(marketing)/newsletter/page.tsx`, NOT in the layout. The CONTEXT.md explicitly states "No sticky CTA on homepage."
**Warning signs:** A floating email form bar appears at the bottom of the consulting homepage.

### Pitfall 6: Full Page Reload Between Routes
**What goes wrong:** Navigating between / and /newsletter triggers a full page reload instead of a smooth client-side transition.
**Why it happens:** Pages are in different route groups with different root layouts, or Link component is not used.
**How to avoid:** Keep all marketing pages in the same `(marketing)` route group with the same layout chain. Use Next.js `<Link>` component (not `<a>` tags) for all internal navigation. This was confirmed: same-layout-group navigation preserves layout state and uses client-side transitions.
**Warning signs:** Browser URL bar flashes, scroll position resets, nav bar re-renders on navigation.

## Code Examples

Verified patterns from the existing codebase:

### Existing Hero Animation Pattern (to replicate for ConsultingHero)
```typescript
// Source: components/landing/hero.tsx (lines 9-28)
// This EXACT pattern should be used for the new consulting hero
const containerVariants = {
  hidden: {},
  visible: {
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.15,
    },
  },
};

const childVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      duration: 0.6,
      ease: [0.25, 0.4, 0.25, 1],
    },
  },
};
```

### Existing Card Grid Pattern (to replicate for "What I Build" cards)
```typescript
// Source: components/landing/example-cards.tsx (lines 76-89, 129-158)
// Card grid with staggered viewport animations
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 30 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true, margin: "-50px" }}
  transition={{
    duration: 0.5,
    delay: index * 0.08,
    ease: [0.25, 0.4, 0.25, 1],
  }}
  className="group rounded-xl border border-border bg-surface p-5 transition-shadow duration-300 hover:shadow-lg hover:shadow-accent/5"
>
```

### Button Variants Available (for CTAs)
```typescript
// Source: components/ui/button.tsx
// Primary (blue, high-contrast): "Work With Me" button
<Button variant="primary" size="lg">Work With Me</Button>

// Secondary (bordered): "Get the Daily Briefing" button
<Button variant="secondary" size="md">Get the Daily Briefing</Button>

// Ghost (minimal): Text-style links
<Button variant="ghost" size="sm">Learn more</Button>
```

### Theme Token Reference (from globals.css)
```css
/* Source: app/globals.css -- ALL colors must use these tokens */
:root {
  --background: #fafafa;      /* bg-background */
  --foreground: #0f172a;      /* text-foreground */
  --muted: #64748b;           /* text-muted */
  --muted-foreground: #94a3b8; /* text-muted-foreground */
  --border: #e2e8f0;          /* border-border */
  --accent: #2563eb;          /* bg-accent, text-accent */
  --accent-foreground: #ffffff; /* text-accent-foreground */
  --accent-hover: #1d4ed8;    /* bg-accent-hover */
  --surface: #ffffff;          /* bg-surface */
  --surface-hover: #f8fafc;   /* bg-surface-hover */
  --surface-active: #f1f5f9;  /* bg-surface-active */
}
```

### Active Link Detection Pattern (for nav bar)
```typescript
// Source: Next.js App Router API -- usePathname()
"use client";
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";
import Link from "next/link";

function NavLink({ href, children }: { href: string; children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const isActive = pathname === href;

  return (
    <Link
      href={href}
      className={`text-sm font-medium transition-colors ${
        isActive ? "text-foreground" : "text-muted hover:text-foreground"
      }`}
    >
      {children}
    </Link>
  );
}
```

## State of the Art

| Old Approach | Current Approach | When Changed | Impact |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| Pages Router with _app.tsx wrapping | App Router with layout.tsx nesting | Next.js 13+ (stable since 14) | Route groups, nested layouts, per-page metadata, Server Components by default |
| framer-motion AnimatePresence for page transitions | Per-section viewport animations with whileInView | Framer Motion 10+ | Simpler, no FrozenRouter hacks needed, works reliably with App Router |
| Tailwind v3 with tailwind.config.js | Tailwind v4 with @theme inline in CSS | 2024-2025 | No config file needed, CSS custom properties native, @import "tailwindcss" replaces @tailwind directives |
| React 18 useFormState | React 19 useActionState | React 19 (2024) | Already using this in hero.tsx and sticky-cta.tsx -- confirmed working |

**Deprecated/outdated:**
- `useFormState` from `react-dom`: Replaced by `useActionState` from `react` (already using the correct one)
- `@tailwind base/components/utilities` directives: Replaced by `@import "tailwindcss"` in v4 (already using the correct one)
- Tailwind `tailwind.config.js`: Replaced by `@theme inline` in CSS (already using the correct one)

## Open Questions

1. **About Section: Full vs. Condensed on Homepage**
   - What we know: CONTEXT.md says "Proof section" includes trust strip, about block, and newsletter teaser. The about section is 13 lines of copy with photo and stats.
   - What's unclear: Whether the full about section is too much for a homepage that should be "scannable in 10 seconds."
   - Recommendation: Use a condensed version on homepage -- photo, stats row, and 1-2 paragraphs max. Link to full about on /newsletter or keep full version only on /newsletter. This is Claude's discretion per CONTEXT.md.

2. **Mobile Nav: Hamburger vs. Inline**
   - What we know: Only 2 nav links (Newsletter, Work With Me) plus logo. CONTEXT.md says either approach is acceptable.
   - What's unclear: Which feels more premium for a consultant's site.
   - Recommendation: Inline links on mobile (no hamburger). Two short links easily fit on any mobile screen, and a hamburger menu for just 2 items feels over-engineered. Use `hidden md:flex` / `flex md:hidden` patterns for any needed responsive adjustments. This is Claude's discretion per CONTEXT.md.

3. **Legal Pages Nav Integration**
   - What we know: Legal pages currently have their own layout with a "Back to home" link. The new marketing layout will add a nav bar.
   - What's unclear: Whether legal pages should show the full nav bar or keep their minimal "back to home" style.
   - Recommendation: Legal pages get the nav bar from the marketing layout automatically (it wraps all routes in the group). The legal layout's "Back to home" link can remain or be removed -- the nav bar serves the same purpose. Simplest approach: keep both; the "Back to home" inside the legal article area provides context-specific navigation.

- [Next.js Route Groups docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-groups) -- route group conventions, layout sharing
- [Next.js Layouts and Pages docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages) -- nested layout behavior, layout preservation during navigation
- [Next.js generateMetadata docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata) -- per-page metadata, inheritance rules
- [Next.js Linking and Navigating docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/linking-and-navigating) -- Link component, client-side navigation

### Secondary (MEDIUM confidence)
- [Framer Motion page transitions blog](https://blog.olivierlarose.com/articles/nextjs-page-transition-guide) -- confirmed AnimatePresence-based page transitions are complex with App Router, per-section animations are simpler
- [Next.js route groups discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/50034) -- multiple root layouts cause full page reloads (reason to keep everything in one route group)

### Tertiary (LOW confidence)
- None. All findings verified against codebase and official documentation.

## Metadata

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Standard stack: HIGH -- no new dependencies, all versions verified from package.json
- Architecture: HIGH -- routing patterns verified against Next.js 16 docs and existing codebase structure
- Pitfalls: HIGH -- derived from direct codebase analysis and known App Router behaviors
- Component patterns: HIGH -- copied directly from existing working components

**Research date:** 2026-02-21
**Valid until:** 2026-03-21 (stable -- no fast-moving dependencies)
