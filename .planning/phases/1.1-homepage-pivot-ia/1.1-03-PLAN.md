<objective>
Create the /work-with-me placeholder page and update root metadata to consulting-first messaging.

Purpose: Complete the three-front-door architecture (/, /newsletter, /work-with-me). The placeholder ensures the "Work With Me" CTA from the homepage has a working destination. Root metadata update ensures social media previews reflect the consulting-first positioning (Pitfall #3 from research).

Output: /work-with-me placeholder page, updated root layout metadata.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create /work-with-me placeholder page</name>
  <files>
    app/(marketing)/work-with-me/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Create placeholder page (`app/(marketing)/work-with-me/page.tsx`):**
- Create as a Server Component that imports a client component wrapper for animation (or use a simple "use client" page -- either approach is fine for a placeholder)
- The page gets the NavBar automatically from the marketing layout (Plan 01)
- Design: A styled "coming soon" card centered on the page -- not a bare text page
- Content structure:
  1. A heading: "Let's Build Something" or "Work With Me" -- confident, inviting
  2. A brief message (2-3 sentences): Something like "I'm building out the full intake experience here. In the meantime, I'd love to hear what you're working on." Tone: warm, direct, not apologetic ("Sorry, coming soon!" is wrong -- "I'd love to hear from you" is right)
  3. Contact CTA: "Email me at lucas@lucassenechal.com" with a mailto: link. Use the Button component with `variant="primary"` for the email link, or a styled anchor tag
  4. Optional: A secondary note like "Or grab the daily briefing while you wait" with a Link to /newsletter -- cross-pollination
- Styling:
  - Center the card vertically and horizontally: `min-h-[60vh] flex items-center justify-center`
  - Card: `max-w-lg mx-auto px-6 text-center`
  - Use `rounded-xl border border-border bg-surface p-8 md:p-12` for the card container
  - Heading: `text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-foreground`
  - Body text: `text-muted text-lg`
- Animation: Simple fade-up entrance using Framer Motion (import motion, use initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }} animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }})
- Export page-specific metadata:
  - title: "Work With Me | Lucas Senechal"
  - description: "AI systems consulting -- automation, process optimization, and ongoing management. Let's talk about what AI can do for your business."
  - openGraph with url: "https://lucassenechal.com/work-with-me"
- Use ONLY theme tokens. No raw colors.
- Import Footer from `@/components/landing/footer` and render it below the card section
  </action>
  <verify>
- Run `npx next build` and confirm no build errors
- Verify `app/(marketing)/work-with-me/page.tsx` exists
- Verify it exports metadata with "Work With Me" in the title
- Verify it contains a mailto link to lucas@lucassenechal.com
- Start dev server, visit http://localhost:3000/work-with-me -- should render styled placeholder with nav bar
  </verify>
  <done>
- /work-with-me renders a styled placeholder card with heading, message, contact email, and optional newsletter cross-link
- Page has Framer Motion entrance animation
- Page has consulting-focused metadata
- NavBar appears (inherited from marketing layout)
- Footer renders at the bottom
- Tone is warm and inviting, not apologetic
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update root metadata to consulting-first</name>
  <files>
    app/layout.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Update root layout metadata (`app/layout.tsx`):**
- Update the `metadata` export to reflect consulting-first positioning
- The current metadata says "Your Daily Edge" and describes the newsletter. This must change to consulting-first messaging.
- New metadata:
  ```typescript
  export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: "Lucas Senechal — AI Systems That Scale Revenue Without Scaling Headcount",
    description:
      "I build AI systems that eliminate repetitive admin and follow-ups so teams scale revenue without scaling headcount. Consulting, automation, and ongoing management.",
    openGraph: {
      title: "Lucas Senechal — AI Systems Consulting",
      description:
        "AI automation, process consulting, and ongoing management. I build systems that do your busywork so you can focus on growth.",
      url: "https://lucassenechal.com",
      siteName: "Lucas Senechal",
      locale: "en_US",
      type: "website",
    },
    twitter: {
      card: "summary_large_image",
      title: "Lucas Senechal — AI Systems Consulting",
      description:
        "I build AI systems that eliminate repetitive admin and follow-ups so teams scale revenue without scaling headcount.",
    },
  };
  ```
- DO NOT modify anything else in the root layout -- keep font loading, html structure, body classes exactly as they are
- The root metadata serves as the default; each page.tsx overrides with page-specific metadata (newsletter page has its own, work-with-me has its own, homepage has its own from Plan 02)
  </action>
  <verify>
- Run `npx next build` and confirm no build errors
- Verify `app/layout.tsx` metadata no longer contains "Your Daily Edge" or newsletter-only messaging
- Verify metadata.title contains "AI Systems" or consulting-focused phrasing
- Verify openGraph.url is still "https://lucassenechal.com"
  </verify>
  <done>
- Root layout metadata reflects consulting-first positioning
- Title, description, openGraph, and twitter metadata all use consulting-focused copy
- Newsletter references removed from root metadata (they live in /newsletter page metadata now)
- Font loading and layout structure unchanged
  </done>
</task>
