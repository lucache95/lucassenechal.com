# Phase 1.1 Plan 03: Work-With-Me Placeholder + Root Metadata Summary

**Styled /work-with-me placeholder with Framer Motion entrance animation, mailto CTA, and consulting-first root metadata replacing newsletter-focused social previews**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-22T04:30:40Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-22T04:32:39Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- /work-with-me renders a polished placeholder card with "Let's Build Something" heading, inviting copy, and prominent mailto link to lucas@lucassenechal.com
- Root layout metadata updated from newsletter-focused "Your Daily Edge" to consulting-first "AI Systems That Scale Revenue Without Scaling Headcount"
- Three-front-door architecture complete: / (consulting homepage), /newsletter (newsletter landing), /work-with-me (consulting placeholder)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create /work-with-me placeholder page** - `81e95b7` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Update root metadata to consulting-first** - `4fa47ef` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `app/(marketing)/work-with-me/page.tsx` - Server Component with consulting-focused metadata and page composition
- `app/(marketing)/work-with-me/work-with-me-card.tsx` - Client Component with Framer Motion fade-up animation, heading, copy, mailto CTA, and newsletter cross-link
- `app/layout.tsx` - Root metadata updated to consulting-first title, description, OpenGraph, and Twitter cards

## Decisions Made
- Split page into Server Component + Client Component wrapper to support both metadata export and Framer Motion animation (Next.js constraint: metadata can only be exported from Server Components)
- Used styled anchor tag matching Button primary variant for mailto link rather than importing Button component (anchor tags cannot use button component without polymorphic "as" prop)
- Included newsletter cross-link ("grab the daily briefing while you wait") for funnel cross-pollination

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Split page into Server/Client components for metadata export**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (Create /work-with-me placeholder page)
- **Issue:** Plan suggested "use client" page was fine, but metadata exports only work from Server Components in Next.js
- **Fix:** Created work-with-me-card.tsx as client component for Framer Motion, kept page.tsx as server component for metadata
- **Files modified:** app/(marketing)/work-with-me/page.tsx, app/(marketing)/work-with-me/work-with-me-card.tsx
- **Verification:** Build passes, metadata exports correctly, animation renders
- **Committed in:** 81e95b7 (Task 1 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 blocking)
**Impact on plan:** Necessary for correctness -- metadata export requires Server Component. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- All three front doors of the site architecture are live and reachable
- NavBar "Work With Me" link now resolves to actual content instead of 404
- Root metadata ensures social media previews reflect consulting positioning
- Ready for Phase 2 (subscriber onboarding) and Phase 3 (consulting funnel to replace placeholder)

## Self-Check: PASSED

All files verified present. All commits verified in git log.
