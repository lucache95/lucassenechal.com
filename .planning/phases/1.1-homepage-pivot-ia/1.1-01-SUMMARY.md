# Phase 1.1 Plan 01: Newsletter Page Migration + Shared Navigation Bar Summary

**Newsletter page at /newsletter composing all 7 landing components with shared NavBar featuring active link detection and Framer Motion glassmorphism header**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-22T04:26:35Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-22T04:28:08Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- /newsletter page renders all 7 existing landing components (HeroSection, TrustStrip, ExampleCards, HowItWorks, About, Footer, StickyCTA) with newsletter-specific metadata
- Shared NavBar component with "Lucas Senechal" logo, "Newsletter" and "Work With Me" links, active state detection via usePathname
- Marketing layout updated to render NavBar on all marketing pages while remaining a Server Component

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create /newsletter page and nav bar component** - `868017d` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Wire nav bar into marketing layout** - `cf1e6e4` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `app/(marketing)/newsletter/page.tsx` - Newsletter landing page composing all existing landing components with OG metadata
- `components/navigation/nav-bar.tsx` - Shared nav bar with logo, links, active state, Framer Motion entrance animation, glassmorphism styling
- `app/(marketing)/layout.tsx` - Marketing layout updated to render NavBar above children

## Decisions Made
- NavBar uses sticky positioning with glassmorphism effect (bg-background/80 backdrop-blur-sm border-b border-border) matching Phase 1 design quality
- No hamburger menu -- only 2 nav links renders cleanly inline on all screen sizes, avoids unnecessary complexity per research recommendation
- Newsletter page is an exact content migration -- zero modifications to existing landing/* components ensures no regression risk

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- /newsletter page is live and rendering all existing content -- safe to replace homepage in 1.1-02
- NavBar component ready for all marketing pages -- "Work With Me" link will work once /work-with-me route is created in 1.1-03
- Marketing layout pattern established for future pages

## Self-Check: PASSED

All files verified present. All commits verified in git log.
