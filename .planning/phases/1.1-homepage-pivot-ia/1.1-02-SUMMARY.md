# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns: ["Homepage components in components/homepage/ directory", "Server Component page composing Client Component sections", "F/G/E copy framework for consulting positioning"]

key-decisions:
  - "Headline uses F/G/E framework: 'I Build AI Systems That Do Your Busywork' -- fear of falling behind, greed for leverage, ego of modernizing"
  - "Homepage is a routing page, not a convincing page -- scannable in 10 seconds with clear CTA hierarchy"
  - "No StickyCTA on homepage per CONTEXT.md decision -- sticky CTAs reserved for newsletter page only"
  - "Newsletter teaser positioned after About section to serve as proof-of-work bridge between credibility and conversion"

patterns-established:
  - "Homepage-specific components live in components/homepage/"
  - "Service cards use whileInView viewport-triggered stagger animation matching example-cards pattern"
  - "Homepage reuses shared components (TrustStrip, About, Footer) without modification"

# Phase 1.1 Plan 02: Consulting-First Homepage Summary

**Consulting-first homepage with F/G/E hero, 4 service category cards, dual CTA routing (Work With Me + Daily Briefing), and proof-of-work newsletter teaser**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-22T04:30:43Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-22T04:32:24Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- ConsultingHero renders headline ("I Build AI Systems That Do Your Busywork"), blurb, primary "Work With Me" CTA, and secondary "Get the Daily Briefing" CTA with stagger animation
- WhatIBuild renders 4 service category cards (AI Automation, Process Consulting, Ongoing Management, Training & Enablement) in responsive grid with viewport-triggered stagger
- NewsletterTeaser renders proof-of-work pitch ("Every day, my AI researches and writes a personalized briefing") with CTA linking to /newsletter
- Homepage page.tsx completely replaced: ConsultingHero -> WhatIBuild -> TrustStrip -> About -> NewsletterTeaser -> Footer with consulting-first metadata

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create homepage components (ConsultingHero, WhatIBuild, NewsletterTeaser)** - `5b53ea7` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Compose consulting-first homepage** - `644b57b` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `components/homepage/consulting-hero.tsx` - Consulting-first hero with F/G/E headline, blurb, and dual CTAs with Framer Motion stagger animation
- `components/homepage/what-i-build.tsx` - 4 service category cards in responsive grid (1/2/4 cols) with whileInView stagger animation
- `components/homepage/newsletter-teaser.tsx` - Compact proof-of-work section with Daily Briefing CTA and fade-up animation
- `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` - Completely rewritten to compose consulting homepage with metadata

## Decisions Made
- Headline uses F/G/E framework: "I Build AI Systems That Do Your Busywork" -- directly addresses the pain (busywork) while implying the gain (AI does it for you)
- Homepage is a routing page, not a convincing page -- minimal copy, clear CTA hierarchy, scannable in 10 seconds
- No StickyCTA on homepage per explicit CONTEXT.md decision
- Newsletter teaser positioned after About for natural flow: hero (value prop) -> services (what) -> trust (proof) -> about (who) -> newsletter (proof-of-work bridge) -> footer

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Homepage consulting pivot complete -- visitors see consulting-first messaging immediately
- "Work With Me" CTA links to /work-with-me (currently a placeholder page, will be built in Phase 3)
- "Get the Daily Briefing" CTA links to /newsletter which renders the full newsletter landing experience
- Newsletter page at /newsletter unaffected and still renders all 7 original landing components with StickyCTA
- Ready for 1.1-03 (Work With Me placeholder page) to complete Phase 1.1

## Self-Check: PASSED
