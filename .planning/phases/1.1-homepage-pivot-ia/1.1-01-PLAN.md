<objective>
Migrate existing newsletter landing page content to /newsletter route and add shared navigation bar across all marketing pages.

Purpose: Establish the routing foundation before the homepage is replaced. Creating the newsletter page FIRST ensures zero content loss during the homepage pivot (Pitfall #1 from research). The shared nav bar enables navigation between the three front doors.

Output: /newsletter page rendering all existing landing content, shared NavBar component, updated marketing layout.

  <name>Task 1: Create /newsletter page and nav bar component</name>
  <files>
    app/(marketing)/newsletter/page.tsx
    components/navigation/nav-bar.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Newsletter page (`app/(marketing)/newsletter/page.tsx`):**
- Create the file as a Server Component (no "use client")
- Import and compose ALL existing landing components in this exact order: HeroSection, TrustStrip, ExampleCards, HowItWorks, About, Footer, StickyCTA
- Copy the exact composition from current `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` -- identical imports, identical JSX structure
- Export page-specific metadata:
  - title: "The Daily Briefing | Lucas Senechal"
  - description: "Your daily edge, researched by AI. A personalized newsletter tailored to exactly what you care about."
  - openGraph with url: "https://lucassenechal.com/newsletter"
- The newsletter page is a straight content migration -- NO modifications to any imported components

**Nav bar (`components/navigation/nav-bar.tsx`):**
- Mark as "use client" (needs usePathname for active link detection)
- Import `usePathname` from `next/navigation` and `Link` from `next/link`
- Structure: fixed/sticky header bar with:
  - Left: "Lucas Senechal" text mark as Link to "/" -- use `text-lg font-semibold text-foreground`
  - Right: Two nav links -- "Newsletter" (href="/newsletter") and "Work With Me" (href="/work-with-me")
- Active link detection: use `usePathname()` to compare current path. Active link gets `text-foreground font-medium`, inactive gets `text-muted hover:text-foreground transition-colors`
- Use Framer Motion for subtle entrance animation: fade in + slide down from -10px on mount
- Styling: `bg-background/80 backdrop-blur-sm border-b border-border` for the glassmorphism nav effect
- Responsive: Show both links inline on all screen sizes (only 2 items -- no hamburger menu needed per research recommendation). Use `gap-6` between links on desktop, `gap-4` on mobile
- Add appropriate padding: `px-6 md:px-8 py-4` with `max-w-6xl mx-auto` container
- Use ONLY theme tokens from globals.css -- no raw Tailwind colors
  </action>
  <verify>
- Run `npx next build` and confirm no build errors
- Verify `app/(marketing)/newsletter/page.tsx` exists and imports all 7 landing components
- Verify `components/navigation/nav-bar.tsx` exists, has "use client", imports usePathname
- Grep for raw color values in nav-bar.tsx (should find none -- only theme tokens)
  </verify>
  <done>
- /newsletter page composes all 7 existing landing components (HeroSection, TrustStrip, ExampleCards, HowItWorks, About, Footer, StickyCTA)
- Newsletter page exports page-specific metadata
- NavBar component renders with logo, two nav links, and active state detection
- NavBar uses Framer Motion entrance animation and glassmorphism styling
- All styling uses theme tokens exclusively
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Wire nav bar into marketing layout</name>
  <files>
    app/(marketing)/layout.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Update marketing layout (`app/(marketing)/layout.tsx`):**
- Keep this file as a Server Component (do NOT add "use client")
- Import NavBar from `@/components/navigation/nav-bar`
- Render NavBar above {children} inside the fragment
- Structure:
  ```
  <>
    <NavBar />
    {children}
  </>
  ```
- This ensures every page under (marketing)/ -- homepage, newsletter, work-with-me, and legal pages -- gets the nav bar automatically
- DO NOT add StickyCTA here (it belongs only on the newsletter page per CONTEXT.md decision "No sticky CTA on homepage")
- DO NOT add "use client" to this layout -- the NavBar is already a client component; the layout must remain a Server Component to support metadata exports in child pages (Pitfall #2 from research)

**Verify the legal layout still works:** The legal pages at /legal/privacy and /legal/terms have their own nested layout with "Back to home" navigation. The marketing layout nav bar wraps OUTSIDE the legal layout. Both nav elements will render -- the top nav bar from the marketing layout and the "Back to home" link inside the legal article area. This is intentional and correct (per research Open Question #3).
  </action>
  <verify>
- Run `npx next build` and confirm no build errors
- Verify `app/(marketing)/layout.tsx` imports NavBar and does NOT contain "use client"
- Start dev server (`npx next dev`), visit http://localhost:3000/newsletter -- should see nav bar + all existing landing page content
- Visit http://localhost:3000/legal/privacy -- should see nav bar + legal layout with "Back to home" link
- Navigate from / to /newsletter using the nav links -- should be client-side navigation (no full page reload, nav bar persists without re-rendering)
  </verify>
  <done>
- Marketing layout imports and renders NavBar above children
- Marketing layout remains a Server Component (no "use client")
- NavBar appears on all marketing pages (/, /newsletter, /legal/*)
- Client-side navigation works between routes within the (marketing) group
  </done>
</task>

1. `npx next build` completes without errors
2. /newsletter renders identical content to the current homepage (hero, trust strip, example cards, how-it-works, about, footer, sticky CTA)
3. Nav bar appears on all marketing pages with "Lucas Senechal" logo, "Newsletter" link, "Work With Me" link
4. Active link is visually highlighted in the nav bar
5. Navigation between pages is client-side (no full reload, layout persists)
6. NavBar has Framer Motion entrance animation
7. All pages remain responsive on mobile

- /newsletter is a fully functional page rendering all existing landing page components with newsletter-specific metadata
- Shared nav bar renders on all marketing pages with active state detection
- Layout remains a Server Component, nav bar is a Client Component
- Zero modifications to existing landing/* components
- Build passes with no errors or warnings
