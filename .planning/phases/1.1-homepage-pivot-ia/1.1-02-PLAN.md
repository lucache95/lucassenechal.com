<objective>
Build the consulting-first homepage with new hero section, "What I Build" service cards, proof section, and compose it all in the homepage page.tsx.

Purpose: This is the core deliverable of Phase 1.1 -- transforming the homepage from newsletter-first to consulting-first. The homepage becomes the primary "routing" page that directs high-intent visitors to /work-with-me and low/medium-intent visitors to /newsletter.

Output: Three new homepage components (ConsultingHero, WhatIBuild, NewsletterTeaser) and a rewritten page.tsx composing them with reused shared components.

  <action>
**ConsultingHero (`components/homepage/consulting-hero.tsx`):**
- Mark as "use client" (needs Framer Motion)
- Use the EXACT same animation pattern from existing `components/landing/hero.tsx`: containerVariants with staggerChildren: 0.15, childVariants with opacity/y fade-up, same easing [0.25, 0.4, 0.25, 1]
- Layout: centered text, generous vertical padding (py-24 md:py-32), max-w-4xl container
- Headline: A compelling consulting-first headline communicating the core value prop -- AI systems that eliminate repetitive admin and follow-ups so teams scale revenue without scaling headcount. Use F/G/E framework. Example: "I Build AI Systems That Do Your Busywork" or similar. Do NOT use "30/60 days" or specific timeframe promises. Use `text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-bold text-foreground tracking-tight`
- Blurb: 1-2 sentences under the headline, plain language. Example: "Repetitive admin, missed follow-ups, manual processes -- I replace them with AI systems so your team scales revenue without scaling headcount." Use `text-lg md:text-xl text-muted max-w-2xl mx-auto`
- Primary CTA: "Work With Me" -- use the existing Button component with `variant="primary"` and `size="lg"`, wrapped in a Next.js Link to `/work-with-me`. This must be visually prominent and high-contrast.
- Secondary CTA: "Get the Daily Briefing" -- use Button with `variant="secondary"` or `variant="ghost"` and `size="md"`, wrapped in a Link to `/newsletter`. Add a small descriptor like "See what my AI builds every day" in `text-sm text-muted` below or beside it.
- CTA layout: Stack vertically on mobile, horizontal on desktop. Use `flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 items-center justify-center`
- Tone: Humble but confident. "I build..." not "I'm the best..." Not corporate, not SaaS. Personal brand + capability.
- Use ONLY theme tokens. No raw colors.

**WhatIBuild (`components/homepage/what-i-build.tsx`):**
- Mark as "use client" (needs Framer Motion)
- Section title: "What I Build" or similar, centered, using `text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-foreground`
- 3-4 cards in a responsive grid: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6`
- Each card: icon (use emoji or simple SVG inline) + title + one-sentence description
- Service categories (from CONTEXT.md):
  1. AI Automation -- "Turn repetitive workflows into AI-powered systems that run themselves"
  2. Process Consulting -- "Audit your operations and design the automation roadmap"
  3. Ongoing Management -- "Keep your AI systems running, improving, and scaling with you"
  4. Training & Enablement -- "Get your team confident building and working alongside AI"
- Card styling: Match existing card pattern from example-cards.tsx -- `rounded-xl border border-border bg-surface p-6 transition-shadow duration-300 hover:shadow-lg hover:shadow-accent/5`
- Animation: Use whileInView viewport-triggered stagger animation (same pattern as example-cards.tsx). Each card fades up with staggered delay: `initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 30 }} whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }} viewport={{ once: true, margin: "-50px" }} transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay: index * 0.08, ease: [0.25, 0.4, 0.25, 1] }}`
- Cards are NOT full service descriptions -- just enough to signal breadth. Full details live on /work-with-me (Phase 3).
- Section padding: `py-20 md:py-24` with `max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 md:px-8`
- Use ONLY theme tokens.

**NewsletterTeaser (`components/homepage/newsletter-teaser.tsx`):**
- Mark as "use client" (needs Framer Motion)
- A compact CTA section: "The newsletter is my proof of work" concept
- Short pitch: Something like "Every day, my AI researches and writes a personalized briefing for each subscriber. It is the best demo of what I build." (1-2 sentences, humble)
- CTA: "Get the Daily Briefing" link/button to /newsletter using Button component with `variant="secondary"` or a styled Link
- Animation: Simple fade-up using containerVariants/childVariants pattern
- Styling: Subtle background differentiation -- use `bg-surface-hover` or `bg-surface` with border-top. Centered text. Padding `py-16 md:py-20`
- This is NOT a full newsletter description section -- it is a lightweight teaser that links to /newsletter for the full pitch
- Use ONLY theme tokens.
  </action>
  <verify>
- Run `npx next build` -- should pass (even though components aren't composed into a page yet, they should have no import errors)
- Verify all three files exist in `components/homepage/`
- Grep for raw color values like `#`, `blue-`, `slate-` in new files (should find none -- only theme tokens)
- Verify each file has "use client" directive
- Verify ConsultingHero contains Link to "/work-with-me" and "/newsletter"
- Verify WhatIBuild renders exactly 4 service cards
  </verify>
  <done>
- ConsultingHero renders headline, blurb, "Work With Me" primary CTA, and "Get the Daily Briefing" secondary CTA with stagger animation
- WhatIBuild renders 4 service category cards in responsive grid with viewport-triggered stagger animations
- NewsletterTeaser renders proof-of-work pitch with CTA linking to /newsletter
- All components use theme tokens exclusively, Framer Motion animations match existing patterns
- F/G/E copy framework applied: fear of falling behind, greed for operational leverage, ego of modernizing

  <name>Task 2: Compose consulting-first homepage</name>
  <files>
    app/(marketing)/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Replace homepage (`app/(marketing)/page.tsx`):**
- COMPLETELY REPLACE the current content (the newsletter landing page content is now at /newsletter from Plan 01)
- Keep this as a Server Component (no "use client" needed -- it just composes client components)
- Import new homepage components:
  - ConsultingHero from `@/components/homepage/consulting-hero`
  - WhatIBuild from `@/components/homepage/what-i-build`
  - NewsletterTeaser from `@/components/homepage/newsletter-teaser`
- Import reused shared components:
  - TrustStrip from `@/components/landing/trust-strip` (reused as-is for proof section)
  - About from `@/components/landing/about` (reused for credibility -- photo, stats, bio)
  - Footer from `@/components/landing/footer` (reused as-is)
- Compose in this order (per CONTEXT.md page structure decision):
  1. ConsultingHero (hero section with dual CTAs)
  2. WhatIBuild (service cards)
  3. TrustStrip (proof -- "Built with the best in the game")
  4. About (credibility -- photo, stats)
  5. NewsletterTeaser (proof-of-work pitch)
  6. Footer
- DO NOT import StickyCTA -- no sticky CTA on homepage (explicit CONTEXT.md decision)
- DO NOT import HeroSection, ExampleCards, or HowItWorks -- those are newsletter-specific and now live only on /newsletter
- Export consulting-first metadata:
  - title: "Lucas Senechal — AI Systems That Scale Revenue Without Scaling Headcount"
  - description: Consulting-first description using F/G/E framing
  - openGraph with url: "https://lucassenechal.com"
  </action>
  <verify>
- Run `npx next build` and confirm no build errors
- Verify page.tsx imports ConsultingHero, WhatIBuild, NewsletterTeaser, TrustStrip, About, Footer
- Verify page.tsx does NOT import HeroSection, ExampleCards, HowItWorks, or StickyCTA
- Verify page.tsx exports metadata with consulting-first title and description
- Start dev server, visit http://localhost:3000 -- should see consulting homepage (not newsletter)
- Visit http://localhost:3000/newsletter -- should still see full newsletter landing page from Plan 01
  </verify>
  <done>
- Homepage at / renders: ConsultingHero -> WhatIBuild -> TrustStrip -> About -> NewsletterTeaser -> Footer
- Homepage has consulting-first metadata (title, description, openGraph)
- No StickyCTA on homepage
- Newsletter page at /newsletter is unaffected and still renders all original landing content
- Both pages share the nav bar from the marketing layout (Plan 01)
  </done>

4. "Work With Me" link on homepage points to /work-with-me
5. "Get the Daily Briefing" link(s) on homepage point to /newsletter
6. No sticky CTA on homepage
7. All new components use Framer Motion animations consistent with existing site
8. Mobile responsive -- all sections stack and read well at 375px width
9. Theme tokens only -- no raw color values in new components
