<objective>
Build the consulting service page landing view — hero section, service cards, how-it-works, FAQ, trust strip, and the CTA that triggers the intake. Replace the existing placeholder /work-with-me page with the full landing experience using a client-side state machine for same-URL transitions.

Purpose: This is the first thing a prospective client sees. It must clearly communicate value, build confidence, and funnel high-intent visitors into the intake. The page state machine enables smooth transitions between landing -> intake -> plan -> booking without route changes (per user decision).

Output: Full consulting landing page with all static sections and state machine shell ready for intake integration.

  <name>Task 1: Create consulting components (hero, service grid, how-it-works, FAQ)</name>
  <files>
    components/consulting/consulting-hero.tsx

    components/consulting/how-it-works.tsx
    components/consulting/faq-section.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
Create `components/consulting/consulting-hero.tsx`:
- 'use client' directive for Framer Motion
- F/G/E copy framework matching the homepage voice. Claude's discretion on exact headline — should communicate: "Stop losing deals to manual follow-ups. Let AI handle the busywork." or similar fear/greed/ego framing for consulting buyers.
- Subheadline: brief (1-2 sentences) explaining the value prop — AI systems that eliminate admin and follow-ups
- One prominent CTA button below: "Tell Me About Your Business" (or similar inviting phrasing)
- Use motion.div with fadeIn/slideUp animation matching homepage ConsultingHero pattern
- Props: onStart callback (called when CTA is clicked, triggers intake transition)
- Responsive: full-width on mobile, centered with max-w-4xl on desktop
- Use project's existing color tokens (text-foreground, text-muted, bg-accent, etc.)

Create `components/consulting/service-grid.tsx`:
- 'use client' for Framer Motion stagger animations
- Grid of 4 service cards matching the exact same visual style as `components/homepage/what-i-build.tsx` (rounded-xl border, hover shadow, emoji icons, same padding)
- Import service data from `lib/data/services.ts` if Plan 01 is complete, otherwise inline the same 4 services (AI Automation, Process Consulting, Ongoing Management, Training & Enablement) with same icons and descriptions as what-i-build.tsx
- NO service pre-selection — user decision says "AI determines which service fits from intake answers"
- No individual CTAs on cards. The single page-level CTA handles conversion.
- Use whileInView stagger animation matching homepage pattern (delay: index * 0.08)

Create `components/consulting/how-it-works.tsx`:
- 'use client' for Framer Motion
- 3-step horizontal visual: (1) Answer Questions (2) Get Your Plan (3) Book a Call
- Each step: numbered circle + title + brief description
- Connected by lines/arrows between steps
- Responsive: horizontal on desktop, vertical stack on mobile
- Framer Motion stagger entrance animation

Create `components/consulting/faq-section.tsx`:
- 'use client' for Framer Motion accordion
- 3-4 FAQ items addressing common consulting objections. Claude's discretion on content. Suggested:
  1. "How long does a typical project take?" — Depends on scope, MVP in 2-4 weeks, full system in 6-12 weeks
  2. "What if I'm not sure what I need?" — That's exactly what the intake is for. Answer a few questions and get a custom plan.
  3. "Do I need technical expertise on my team?" — No. I handle the technical side. You focus on your business.
  4. "What does the discovery call cost?" — Nothing. 15 minutes, no obligation. If we're a fit, I'll send a proposal.
- Accordion pattern: click to expand/collapse answer with AnimatePresence height animation
- Use border-b dividers between items

All 4 component files exist and export their named components.
`npx tsc --noEmit` passes for all new files.
No import errors when referencing project design tokens.
  </verify>
  <done>
4 consulting page components created: hero with F/G/E copy and CTA callback, service grid matching homepage card style, 3-step how-it-works visual, and 3-4 item FAQ accordion. All use Framer Motion animations consistent with existing site.

  <name>Task 2: Replace placeholder page with state machine and compose landing view</name>
  <files>
    app/(marketing)/work-with-me/page.tsx
    app/(marketing)/work-with-me/work-with-me-client.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
Replace `app/(marketing)/work-with-me/work-with-me-client.tsx` completely (remove existing placeholder card):
- 'use client' directive
- Define `FunnelStage` type: 'landing' | 'intake' | 'generating' | 'plan' | 'booking' | 'complete'
- useState for current stage, starting at 'landing'
- useState for intake answers (empty array initially) and session data
- AnimatePresence mode="wait" wrapping stage-specific content
- For 'landing' stage: render ConsultingHero (with onStart={() => setStage('intake'))), ServiceGrid, HowItWorks, TrustStrip (from components/landing/trust-strip.tsx — reuse per user decision), FAQSection, Footer
- For 'intake' stage: placeholder div with text "Intake coming in Plan 03" (will be replaced by IntakeContainer)
- For 'generating' stage: placeholder div
- For 'plan' stage: placeholder div
- For 'booking' stage: placeholder div
- For 'complete' stage: placeholder div
- Each stage wrapped in motion.div with key={stage} and fade/slide variants for smooth transition
- Scroll to top when stage changes (window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' }))

Update `app/(marketing)/work-with-me/page.tsx`:
- Keep as Server Component for metadata
- Update metadata to be more compelling — title: "Work With Me — AI Systems That Eliminate Your Busywork | Lucas Senechal", description: consulting-specific value prop
- Import and render WorkWithMeClient as the sole child (no wrapping section/Footer — client component handles layout)
- Remove the old section wrapper and separate Footer import (client component includes Footer in landing stage)
  </action>
  <verify>
`npm run build` compiles successfully (or `npx tsc --noEmit` if build is slow).
Navigate to /work-with-me and see: hero, service cards, how-it-works, trust strip, FAQ, footer.
Clicking the CTA button transitions to the intake placeholder (stage changes visually).
No console errors in browser.
  </verify>
  <done>
/work-with-me placeholder replaced with full consulting landing page. State machine manages landing/intake/generating/plan/booking/complete stages with AnimatePresence transitions. Landing view shows hero, service cards, how-it-works, trust strip, FAQ, and footer. CTA triggers transition to intake stage. Metadata updated for consulting SEO.
  </done>
</task>

<success_criteria>
A prospective client visiting /work-with-me sees a polished consulting page with clear value prop, service offerings, process explanation, social proof, and FAQ. One CTA triggers a smooth transition to the intake (placeholder). No pricing displayed. Tone is humble but confident with F/G/E framing.
