<objective>
Build the complete landing page with all visual sections, F/G/E copy, Framer Motion animations, and responsive design. This is the first thing visitors see — it must be polished, alive, and conversion-focused.

Purpose: The landing page IS the product's first impression. It must communicate personalized value, demonstrate breadth of topics, and capture email addresses. Every design decision serves conversion.
Output: A fully responsive, animated landing page with hero, example cards, how-it-works, trust strip, sticky CTA, and footer.

  </files>
  <action>
    **UI Components first:**

    1. **components/ui/button.tsx** — Create a reusable Button component:
       - Accept variants: `primary` (dark bg, light text), `secondary` (outline), `ghost` (transparent)
       - Accept sizes: `sm`, `md`, `lg`
       - Support disabled state with reduced opacity
       - Use Tailwind classes with smooth transitions
       - Export as both default and named export

    2. **components/ui/input.tsx** — Create a reusable Input component:
       - Styled email input with proper focus ring
       - Support disabled state
       - Clean border, generous padding, rounded corners
       - Integrate with form action pattern (no controlled state needed for Server Actions)

    **Marketing layout:**

    3. **app/(marketing)/layout.tsx** — Create route group layout for public marketing pages:
       - Simple wrapper, no navigation bar needed yet (single page)
       - Pass children through cleanly
       - This keeps marketing pages separate from future app pages

    4. **app/page.tsx** — Update root page to redirect or re-export the marketing page. The simplest approach: make the root `app/page.tsx` import and render from the marketing route group, OR move the landing page to `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` and have root redirect.

    **Hero section:**

    5. **components/landing/hero.tsx** — Build the hero section ("use client" for Framer Motion):

       **Layout:** Centered content, generous vertical padding (min-h-[90vh]), max-w-3xl for text.

       **Headline:** Large, bold, tracking-tight. Content following F/G/E edge-focused energy:
       - Main headline: Something like "Your daily edge" or "The briefing that knows what you care about" — confident, punchy, competitive advantage framing
       - Subheadline: Communicate the core value — AI researches topics YOU choose, delivered daily. Weave F/G/E naturally: fear of missing out on what matters, greed for curated intel, ego of being the informed one.

       **Email capture form:**
       - Stacked layout per user decision: email input on top, full-width "Start free" button below
       - Use the reusable Input and Button components
       - Form uses `action` attribute (will wire to Server Action in Plan 03)
       - For now, the form can submit to a placeholder — Plan 03 wires the real action
       - States: idle, loading (button shows spinner), success (show confirmation message), error (show error text)
       - Use `useFormStatus` from react-dom for loading state, or local state with `useActionState`

       **Animations (Framer Motion):**
       - Headline fades in and slides up on mount (staggered: headline first, then subtext, then form)
       - Use `motion.div` with `initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}` pattern
       - Stagger children with `staggerChildren: 0.15`

       **Copy voice:** "Confident friend" — casual, direct, warm. Not salesy, not corporate. Think: a smart friend telling you about something you'd actually want.

       **Responsive:** Text sizes scale from mobile (text-3xl) to desktop (text-6xl or text-7xl). Form is full-width on mobile, constrained on desktop.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run dev`. Navigate to localhost:3000. Verify: (1) Hero section is visible with headline, subheadline, and email form. (2) Stacked email input + button layout. (3) Framer Motion staggered entrance animation plays on page load. (4) Responsive: resize browser to mobile width — text scales down, form remains full-width. (5) No TypeScript or build errors.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Hero section renders with F/G/E copy, stacked email capture form with "Start free" CTA, staggered entrance animations, and responsive scaling from mobile to desktop. Button and Input UI components are reusable.

    app/(marketing)/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Build remaining landing page sections and compose the full page.

    1. **components/landing/example-cards.tsx** ("use client") — Interactive topic cards:

       **Content:** 6-8 example topic cards showing breadth of personalization:
       - AI Tools & Automation (latest releases, tutorials)
       - Local Deals & Events (restaurants, concerts, openings)
       - Business Leads & Opportunities (markets, trends, prospects)
       - Tech News (breaking releases, industry moves)
       - Health & Fitness (research, local gyms, recipes)
       - Finance & Markets (stocks, crypto, economic trends)
       - Creative Inspiration (design trends, music, art)
       - Career & Skills (job market, learning resources, certifications)

       **Layout:** Responsive grid — 1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3-4 col desktop. Cards have consistent height with overflow hidden for expanded content.

       **Hover interaction (per user decision — "cards are static but expand/animate on hover to show a sample newsletter snippet"):**
       - Default state: Topic title + brief 1-line description
       - Hover/tap state: Card expands smoothly to reveal a sample newsletter snippet preview (2-3 lines of example content showing what a subscriber would receive)
       - Use `motion.div` with `animate` based on hover state
       - On mobile, use tap instead of hover (onTap)

       **Animations:**
       - Cards stagger in on scroll using `whileInView` with `viewport={{ once: true }}`
       - Each card delays `index * 0.1` seconds
       - Subtle scale on hover (`whileHover={{ scale: 1.02 }}`)

       **Section header:** Something F/G/E-flavored like "See what your briefing could look like" — greed (look at all this intel) + ego (imagine being this informed).

    2. **components/landing/how-it-works.tsx** ("use client") — 3-step explanation:

       **Content (3 steps):**
       - Step 1: "Tell us what matters to you" — describe topics in plain English, pick categories
       - Step 2: "AI researches it overnight" — multiple sources, fresh content, verified links
       - Step 3: "Wake up informed" — personalized briefing in your inbox, every morning

       **Layout:** Horizontal on desktop (3 columns), vertical on mobile. Each step has an icon/number, title, and description.

       **Animations:** Steps stagger in on scroll. Subtle connecting line or arrow between steps on desktop.

       **Copy:** F/G/E woven naturally — step 1 is ego (you choose), step 2 is greed (AI finds the best stuff), step 3 is fear-relief (never miss what matters).

    3. **components/landing/trust-strip.tsx** ("use client") — Scrolling logo/source bar:

       **Content (per user decision):** Show data sources and technology: Brave Search, Reddit, X, RSS Feeds, News APIs, AI-Powered.

       **Implementation:** Infinite horizontal scroll using CSS animation (marquee pattern):
       - Duplicate the logo set for seamless loop
       - Use CSS `@keyframes marquee` with `translateX(-50%)` on the duplicated set
       - Or use Framer Motion's `animate={{ x: [0, -halfWidth] }}` with `repeat: Infinity`
       - Grayscale logos by default, full color on hover
       - Use SVG text or styled text for source names (avoid needing actual logo image files — use text-based badges like "Brave Search", "Reddit", "X", etc.)

       **Copy:** Small label above like "Powered by real sources" or "Sourced from across the web"

    4. **components/landing/sticky-cta.tsx** ("use client") — Fixed bottom bar:

       **Per user decision:** Sticky floating bar at bottom that follows as they scroll.

       **Implementation:**
       - Fixed position at bottom of viewport
       - Hidden when hero email form is visible (use `useScroll` + `useTransform` to fade in after scrolling past ~20% of page)
       - Contains compact email input + "Start free" button in horizontal layout
       - Background with border-top and shadow for visual separation
       - z-50 to stay above content
       - On mobile: full-width, slightly more padding

    5. **components/landing/footer.tsx** — Simple footer:
       - Links to Privacy Policy and Terms of Service (routes: `/legal/privacy`, `/legal/terms`)
       - Copyright line
       - Minimal, clean design
       - Not a "use client" component — no interactivity needed

    6. **app/(marketing)/page.tsx** — Compose the full landing page:

       Import and render all sections in order:
       ```
       <HeroSection />
       <ExampleCards />
       <HowItWorks />
       <TrustStrip />
       <Footer />
       <StickyCTA />
       ```

       The page itself is a Server Component. All animated children are Client Components.

       **Performance:** Add any above-the-fold images with `priority` attribute. Ensure no unnecessary client-side JavaScript in the page component itself.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run dev`. Full landing page loads at localhost:3000 with all sections visible in order: Hero > Example Cards > How It Works > Trust Strip > Footer. Verify: (1) Example cards expand on hover showing newsletter snippets. (2) How-it-works shows 3 steps. (3) Trust strip scrolls continuously. (4) Sticky CTA bar appears after scrolling past hero. (5) Footer has privacy/terms links. (6) Mobile responsive at 375px width. (7) Desktop layout at 1440px width. (8) No console errors. (9) Run `npm run build` to confirm no build errors.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Complete landing page with all sections rendered, animations working, hover interactions on cards, scrolling trust strip, sticky CTA appearing on scroll, responsive layout on mobile and desktop, and F/G/E copy throughout.

  <name>Task 3: Visual verification of landing page</name>
  <files>app/(marketing)/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Human verification of the complete landing page. What was built:
    Complete landing page with hero (headline + email capture), interactive example cards, how-it-works section, scrolling trust strip, sticky CTA, and footer. Fully responsive with Framer Motion animations and F/G/E copy.

    How to verify:
    1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
    2. **Hero:** Verify headline is compelling, email form is stacked (input above, button below), "Start free" button is prominent
    3. **Animations:** Page loads with staggered fade-in animations — headline, then subtext, then form
    4. **Example cards:** Scroll to cards section. Hover over cards — they should expand to show newsletter snippet preview. Check all 6-8 topics are present and varied.
    5. **How it works:** Verify 3-step flow is clear and reads naturally
    6. **Trust strip:** Verify continuous scrolling logo/source bar
    7. **Sticky CTA:** Scroll down — a bottom bar should appear with email capture
    8. **Footer:** Links to Privacy and Terms visible
    9. **Mobile:** Resize to phone width (~375px). Verify everything stacks properly, text is readable, form is usable
    10. **Copy feel:** Does the overall copy feel like a "confident friend" tone? F/G/E subtle, not heavy-handed?
    11. **Aesthetic:** Does it feel polished and alive (Resend/Linear/ready.so vibe)? Premium without being cold?

    Resume signal: Type "approved" to continue, or describe specific issues to fix (e.g., "cards too small on mobile", "headline feels too generic")
