<objective>
Create privacy policy and terms of service pages with content covering email collection, data storage, third-party services (Supabase, Resend, Twilio), and data retention rules. These are legal requirements for any service that collects email addresses.

Purpose: CAN-SPAM and GDPR compliance require transparent privacy policies. Publishing these before collecting any subscriber data is a legal prerequisite.
Output: Two legal pages accessible from the footer, with comprehensive coverage of data practices and retention rules.
